The error indicates that Crow depends on the **Boost library**, and it is not installed or accessible on your system. Crow requires Boost for handling some of its internal functionalities, like string manipulation.

Hereâ€™s how you can resolve this:

---

### 1. **Install Boost**

#### On Windows:

1. **Download Boost:**
   - Go to the [Boost website](https://www.boost.org/) and download the latest version.

2. **Extract and Install:**
   - Extract the downloaded Boost archive to a directory, e.g., `C:\Boost`.

3. **Set Boost Path for g++:**
   - Add the Boost `include` folder to your g++ command.
   - If Boost is in `C:\Boost`, the include directory will be `C:\Boost\boost_1_xx_x` (replace `xx` with the version you downloaded).

#### On Linux (if applicable):
Install Boost using your package manager:
```bash
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```

---

### 2. **Update the g++ Command**

Compile your code with the Boost include directory:
```cmd
g++ -std=c++17 server.cpp -o server -lpthread -I "C:\Boost\boost_1_xx_x"
```

Replace `C:\Boost\boost_1_xx_x` with the path to your Boost installation's include folder.

---

### 3. **Verify Boost Installation**

Ensure Boost headers are accessible:
1. Create a test file, `boost_test.cpp`:
   ```cpp
   #include <boost/algorithm/string.hpp>
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       std::string test = "Hello, Boost!";
       if (boost::algorithm::starts_with(test, "Hello")) {
           std::cout << "Boost is working!" << std::endl;
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. Compile the test:
   ```cmd
   g++ -std=c++17 boost_test.cpp -o boost_test -I "C:\Boost\boost_1_xx_x"
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```cmd
   boost_test
   ```

If you see `Boost is working!`, your installation is correct.

### 4. **Recompile the Crow Server**
After verifying Boost, recompile `server.cpp` with the updated g++ command:
```cmd
g++ -std=c++17 server.cpp -o server -lpthread -I "C:\Boost\boost_1_xx_x"
```

---

### 5. **Run the Server**
```cmd
server
```
