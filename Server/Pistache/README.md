The error you're encountering, `cannot find -lpistache: No such file or directory`, indicates that the linker can't find the `libpistache` library.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **The library might not have been built correctly.**
2. **The library path might be incorrect or incomplete.**

To fix this:

### Step 1: Ensure Pistache is built correctly
Make sure that you have built Pistache correctly using `cmake` and `make`. If you haven't built it, or if you suspect it failed to build, you can follow these steps:

```bash
cd /c/Users/surface/Documents/GitHub/Concepts-of-CPP/Pistache
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This should generate the necessary files, including `libpistache.a` (or `libpistache.so` on Linux) in the `lib` folder.

### Step 2: Verify the `libpistache` file exists
Check that the library file (`libpistache.a` or `libpistache.dll` on Windows) exists in the `pistache/lib` directory. You can do this by running:

```bash
ls pistache/lib
```

You should see `libpistache.a` or something similar in that directory.

### Step 3: Update your `g++` command
Once you've confirmed that the library file exists in the `pistache/lib` directory, update your `g++` command to:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 server.cpp -o server -Ipistache/include -Lpistache/lib -lpistache
```

Make sure the `-L` path is correct. If `libpistache.a` (or `libpistache.dll` for Windows) is not in `pistache/lib`, you'll need to find where the Pistache library was built and update the path accordingly.

### Additional Note: Using MinGW on Windows
If you're building Pistache with MinGW (as you're on Windows), you may need to make sure you have the appropriate MinGW version installed and that you're using it with the correct environment variables set. Alternatively, consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for better compatibility with libraries like Pistache.
